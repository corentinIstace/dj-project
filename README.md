# DJ-project

## Project done by Corentin, Julien, and Zoé

### About the project :

The objective was to create a static site for a DJ, based on reference photos, responsive (desktop, tablet, and mobile sizes), with some animations and a burger menu.

It's create for my [BeCode](https://becode.org/fr/) formation for learning the principles of:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. responsive web design 
4. using GIT and Github


## Objectives

For this exercice, it was asking to us to write the HTML from a picture and after that, to write the CSS so that our website looks like the picture.

After that we have to use responsive design and to push it on Github.


### HTML:

- write HTML proprely, 
- make the result looks like the picture,
- respected the [HTML sementic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)


### CSS:

- write style.css and link it with the HTML page,
- separate elements into different blocks,
- implement police from [Google font] (https://fonts.google.com/)


### Responsive web design:

- use the [RWD media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)


### Git and [Github](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf):

- create repository and clone it on our local machine,
- create README.md,

    ```HTML
    code README.md
    ```

- open files and work on it,

    ```HTML
    code < file >
    ```
